# playground

Making the Hack Penguin 🐧 dream come true.

## Setup

Make sure you have Go installed. If you don't have Go installed, [click here](https://golang.org/doc/install). (If you're on macOS, I recommend using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh))

### Get Started

To build the project, we use Go's built-in package manager.

```
go build .
```

To run the project, just run the binary:

```
./playground
```
